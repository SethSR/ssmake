# ssmake
A Sega Saturn build-tool created by converting Yaul's makefile system to Rust. Currently, it's just a (bad) copy, but the intended goal of this project is to first, verify my understanding of how the makefile system works by reverse-engineering it, and second, convert relevant (and eventually, all) sections to interface with sslang.
